# Be a full stack developer

When I was young and free and my imagination had no limits,I dreamed of changing the world.As I grew older and wiser, I discovered the world would not change, so I shortened my sights somewhat and decided to change only my country. But it, too, seemed immovable.

As I grew into my twilight years, in one last desperate attempt, I settled for changing only my family, those closest to me, but alas, they would have none of it.

And now, as I lie on my deathbed, I suddenly realize:

If I had only changed myself first, then by example I would have changed my family.From their inspiration and encouragement, I would then have been able to better my country, and who knows, I may have even changed the world.

当我年轻的时候，我的想象力从没有受到过限制，我梦想改变这个世界。

当我成熟以后，我发现我不能改变这个世界，我将目光缩短了些，决定只改变我的国家。

当我进入暮年后，我发现我不能改变我的国家，我的最后愿望仅仅是改变一下我的家庭。但是，这也不可能。

当我躺在床上，行将就木时，我突然意识到：

如果一开始我仅仅去改变我自己，然后作为一个榜样，我可能改变我的家庭；在家人的帮助和鼓励下，我可能为国家做一些事情。然后谁知道呢？我甚至可能改变这个世界。
